Hive Go
========
Voting based go game.  people vote for where the current color should place the stone, highest voted coordinate
gets commited to the game after alloted time  and the next color turn begins.<br/><br/>
Loop until 2 passes are majority voted succesfully.

### Progress ###
I just started working on this... plan to use Node.JS, (hi))Redis, Express, KineticJS, GnuGo and cron.d :)

### MODULES ###
I'm compiling everything (just hiredis so far) on an Arch  x86_64  machine. You may want to `npm install` the dependencies if you attempt to clone this.
